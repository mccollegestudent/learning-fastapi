## üîê Security Emphasis - Nginx and Firewall Setup on Ubuntu 20.04
- **Nginx Integration:** This project includes a robust Nginx setup to serve as a reverse proxy, enhancing security and performance. Nginx not only handles incoming requests efficiently but also acts as a shield, protecting your FastAPI application from common security threats.
- **Firewall Configuration:** We prioritize your app's security by providing a guide on setting up and configuring the firewall on your Ubuntu 20.04 VM. This ensures that only essential services and ports are accessible, minimizing potential vulnerabilities and unauthorized access.


## üìò Documentation
Check out the live demo of the FastAPI Social Media App at [edenschat.xyz](https://edenschat.xyz). Witness firsthand how Nginx and a well-configured firewall contribute to a secure, performant, and responsive user experience.
Currently depoyed on Azure Ubuntu  20.0.4 VM (as of time of documentaion - may change in the future)
